# Story: Basic Document Analysis

## Story Description

As a procurement specialist, I need the extension to perform basic analysis of downloaded technical documents to extract key information, identify relevant terms, and provide an initial assessment of auction relevance, so I can quickly determine if an opportunity matches our company's capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- PDF documents can be processed and text extracted
- OCR is applied to scanned documents to make them machine-readable
- Technical terms relevant to naval repair are identified and highlighted
- Document sections are detected and classified
- Keywords are extracted and weighted by importance
- Initial relevance assessment is performed against company profile
- Document annotations and highlights are visualized
- Document summary is generated with key points

## Story Tasks

1. Implement PDF Processing:
   - Integrate PDF.js for document handling
   - Create document viewer component within the extension
   - Implement text extraction pipeline
   - Build document metadata extraction
   - Develop utilities to handle document encoding issues
   - Implement section detection for structured documents

2. Add OCR Capabilities:
   - Integrate Tesseract.js for scanned documents
   - Implement worker-based processing for performance
   - Create pre-processing for image optimization
   - Build language detection for multi-language support
   - Develop page segmentation for complex layouts
   - Create fallback strategies for low-quality scans

3. Implement Basic Text Analysis:
   - Create NLP pipeline using compromise.js
   - Implement entity recognition for technical terms
   - Build section detection and classification
   - Develop keyword extraction and weighting
   - Create specialized recognizers for naval terminology
   - Implement technical specification pattern matching

4. Develop Initial Relevance Assessment:
   - Create matching algorithm against company profile
   - Implement terminology extraction for naval repair domain
   - Build scoring system for different document sections
   - Develop confidence metrics for relevance scores
   - Create multi-factor evaluation considering technical fit
   - Implement detection of potential disqualifying factors

5. Create Document Visualization:
   - Build document annotation overlay
   - Implement keyword highlighting
   - Create relevance scoring visualization
   - Develop document summary generation
   - Build interactive elements for exploring analysis
   - Implement exportable reports for sharing insights

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed
- Story-03-Company-Profile-Management must be completed
- Story-07-Document-Acquisition must be completed

## Story Risks

- Processing large PDFs may cause performance issues in browser extension
- OCR quality may be insufficient for complex technical documents
- Naval terminology may be diverse and difficult to comprehensively capture
- Different document formats and structures may require custom handling
- Basic NLP may have limitations in understanding complex technical requirements
- Browser extension environment may limit processing capabilities

## Story Assumptions

- Documents are primarily textual with standard formatting
- Technical terminology follows industry standards
- Company profile contains detailed capability information
- Processing can be done within the browser environment
- Basic analysis is sufficient for initial relevance assessment
- More complex analysis will be handled by the companion service in later phases

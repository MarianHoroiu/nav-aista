# Story: Company Profile Management

## Story Description

As a procurement specialist, I need to be able to create, manage, and update company profiles with detailed capability information, so that the extension can accurately match auction opportunities to our company's capabilities and preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Company profile data model is defined with TypeScript interfaces
- Storage implementation uses Chrome Storage API with proper error handling
- Profile management UI allows creation, editing, and deletion of profiles
- User can specify capabilities including ship types, tonnage ranges, and specializations
- Profile data includes certification and qualification storage
- Profile can store location and geographical preferences
- User can create and manage multiple search templates
- Import/export functionality allows backup and transfer of profiles

## Story Tasks

1. Define the Data Model:
   - Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for company profiles
   - Implement validation schemas using Zod or similar library
   - Define interfaces for search templates and other related data structures
   - Create profile migration utilities for version updates
   - Design data structures to support historical performance tracking

2. Implement Storage System:
   - Develop Chrome Storage API wrapper with error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add migration support for schema changes
   - Implement automatic sync between browser instances
   - Create caching layer for performance optimization
   - Implement secure storage for sensitive company information
   - Design storage partitioning for different data categories

3. Build Profile Management UI:
   - Create profile creation wizard with step-by-step flow
   - Implement profile editing interface with validation
   - Build profile import/export functionality
   - Develop visualization components for profile data
   - Implement search template management interface
   - Create interface for viewing historical performance data

4. Implement Profile Versioning:
   - Create version control for profile changes
   - Implement backup mechanisms
   - Add history tracking for profile modifications
   - Create migration utilities for profile structure updates

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed

## Story Risks

- Complexity in designing a flexible yet structured data model for diverse company capabilities
- Security considerations for storing potentially sensitive company information
- Performance issues with large profile datasets in Chrome Storage
- User experience challenges in creating intuitive profile management interfaces
- Cross-browser compatibility issues with storage implementation

## Story Assumptions

- The core extension structure is in place with React components
- Chrome Storage API is sufficient for the profile data volume
- Users will have detailed knowledge of their company capabilities
- Search templates will primarily use fixed criteria rather than AI-generated ones at this stage

# Story: E-licitatie Site Integration

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to analyze and integrate with the e-licitatie.ro auction platform to enable the extension's functionality within the site context. This includes documenting the DOM structure, mapping form elements, and implementing detection and activation logic for the extension.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Detailed DOM structure of e-licitatie.ro auction pages is documented
- Form elements and behaviors are mapped in code
- Extension detection logic for auction pages is implemented
- Context-aware activation rules function correctly
- User notification system for extension activation is working
- Extension properly activates on relevant auction pages
- Permission request handling is properly implemented
- Authentication flow and session management patterns are documented

## Story Tasks

1. Perform comprehensive site analysis:

   - Document the detailed DOM structure of e-licitatie.ro auction pages
   - Map form elements and their behaviors
   - Identify dynamic content loading patterns
   - Document authentication flow and session management
   - Create reference for AJAX patterns used on the site

2. Implement extension activation:

   - Create detection logic for auction pages
   - Develop context-aware activation rules
   - Build extension badge and icon updates based on context
   - Implement permission handling based on page context

3. Develop user notification system:

   - Create non-intrusive user notifications
   - Implement status indicators
   - Build tooltip and help systems
   - Develop error notifications for authentication issues

4. Create site interaction utilities:

   - Build helpers for DOM interaction
   - Create wrappers for common site interactions
   - Implement navigation helpers
   - Develop form element access utilities

5. Implement testing for site integration:
   - Create tests with mock DOM structures
   - Implement integration tests for site detection
   - Develop automated tests for activation logic
   - Build test helpers for e-licitatie.ro DOM simulation

## Story Dependencies

- Story-[01]-[project-initialization] must be completed
- Story-[02]-[core-extension-component-structure] must be completed (for content script architecture)

## Story Risks

- E-licitatie.ro may change their DOM structure, breaking integration
- Authentication patterns may be complex or change over time
- Site performance might vary, requiring robust error handling
- AJAX patterns might interfere with extension functionality
- Site security measures might block certain extension operations
- Romanian language content may present localization challenges

## Story Assumptions

- The e-licitatie.ro site structure remains stable enough for reliable integration
- Extension can access necessary DOM elements on the auction pages
- User will be authenticated on the e-licitatie.ro site before extension functionality is needed
- The site does not implement measures to block extension functionality
- Extension will operate primarily on auction search and listing pages
- Romanian language handling will be needed for form processing

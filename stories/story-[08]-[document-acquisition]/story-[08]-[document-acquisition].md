# Story: Document Acquisition

## Story Description

As a procurement specialist, I need the extension to automatically identify, download, and organize technical documentation attached to auction listings, so I can quickly access and review the detailed requirements without manually navigating through multiple pages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Extension can automatically navigate to auction detail pages
- PDF and compressed archive documents are identified and downloaded
- Document sections are precisely targeted using CSS attribute selectors
- Multiple files within a single auction can be handled
- Downloaded documents are organized and stored accessibly
- Document acquisition process provides feedback and progress indicators
- Downloads can be paused, resumed, and retried in case of errors

## Story Tasks

1. Implement Document Identification:
   - Create system to detect document links on auction pages
   - Implement precise targeting using CSS attribute selectors
   - Build utilities to parse DOM structure for document sections
   - Create fallback mechanisms for different document section formats
   - Develop parser for different document types (PDFs, archives, etc.)
   - Implement filtering mechanism to identify relevant technical documents

2. Develop Document Download System:
   - Create download manager using Chrome download API
   - Implement queue system for multiple documents
   - Build progress tracking and status updates
   - Create error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Implement file format detection and validation
   - Develop archive extraction capabilities for compressed files

3. Build Document Organization System:
   - Create folder structure for downloaded documents
   - Implement naming conventions based on auction metadata
   - Build index system for quick document location
   - Develop document metadata extraction and storage
   - Create document versioning system for updated files
   - Implement cleanup mechanism for outdated documents

4. Implement Download User Interface:
   - Create document list view with status indicators
   - Build download progress visualization
   - Implement download action buttons (pause, resume, retry)
   - Create notification system for download events
   - Develop document preview capabilities
   - Implement document organization interface

5. Create Document Acquisition Strategies:
   - Implement automated acquisition based on result relevance
   - Build batch download capabilities for multiple auctions
   - Create document update detection for changed specifications
   - Develop prioritization system for urgent documents
   - Implement bandwidth management for large downloads
   - Create background download capabilities

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed
- Story-04-E-licitatie-Integration must be completed
- Story-06-Results-Processing must be completed

## Story Risks

- Download permission issues with browser extensions
- Complex document section structures may be difficult to reliably target
- Performance issues with large document downloads
- Storage limitations for documents in browser environment
- Handling diverse file formats and compressed archives
- Download throttling or blocking by the e-licitatie.ro platform

## Story Assumptions

- The extension has appropriate permissions for document downloads
- Document links on auction pages follow consistent patterns
- Documents are primarily PDFs or common archive formats
- Browser extension storage is sufficient or external storage is configured
- Users will want to download and organize documents for offline review

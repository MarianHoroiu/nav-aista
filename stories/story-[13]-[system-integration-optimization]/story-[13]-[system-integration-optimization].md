# Story: System Integration and Optimization

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to integrate all components of the system seamlessly and optimize performance across the entire application, so users experience a cohesive, responsive solution that efficiently processes auctions and delivers valuable insights.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All components are integrated into a unified system
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout of capabilities
- Extension-service interaction is seamless
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring is implemented
- Centralized configuration management is created
- Performance is optimized through caching, resource-aware processing, and offline capabilities
- System performs efficiently under various load conditions
- Health check and self-healing capabilities are implemented

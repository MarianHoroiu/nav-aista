# Story [03]: Smart Form Automation and DOM Interaction

## Story Description

Implement intelligent form automation capabilities for the Naval Auction Assistant extension on e-licitatie.ro. This story encompasses comprehensive DOM parsing, dropdown field analysis with lazy loading support, automated form field completion, search functionality triggering, and intelligent date range selection with predefined intervals. The system will intelligently interact with both standard HTML elements and complex Kendo UI components commonly found on Romanian public procurement platforms.

## Story Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-01**: Extension successfully detects and parses all form elements on e-licitatie.ro pages, including standard HTML and Kendo UI components
- [ ] **AC-02**: Dropdown fields with lazy loading are automatically triggered to populate their options before analysis
- [ ] **AC-03**: Target dropdown fields ("Autoritatea contractanta", "Domeniu de activitate", "Modalitatea de atribuire", "Cod sau denumire CPV") are identified and their options extracted
- [ ] **AC-04**: Form fields are automatically completed with intelligent default values based on field types and labels
- [ ] **AC-05**: Estimated value fields ("De la" input) are populated with configurable default values (minimum 20,000,000 RON)
- [ ] **AC-06**: Publication date range fields support predefined date intervals (this week, last week, this month, last month, this year)
- [ ] **AC-07**: Search/filter button is automatically triggered after form completion to execute queries
- [ ] **AC-08**: Extension provides comprehensive error handling and user feedback throughout the automation process
- [ ] **AC-09**: All form interactions work seamlessly with AngularJS digest cycles and Kendo UI event systems
- [ ] **AC-10**: User can control date range selection through intuitive popup interface with radio button options

## Story Tasks

### Task 01: Enhanced DOM Parser and Dropdown Detection System
**Description**: Implement sophisticated DOM parsing capabilities to detect and categorize all form elements, with special handling for Kendo UI components and lazy-loaded content.

### Task 02: Kendo UI Component Integration Manager
**Description**: Develop specialized utilities to interact with Kendo UI dropdowns, datepickers, and other components, including triggering lazy loading and extracting populated options.

### Task 03: Intelligent Form Field Autocomplete Engine
**Description**: Create a comprehensive form autocompletion system that intelligently fills fields based on their labels, types, and contextual information using predefined business rules.

### Task 04: Advanced Value Input Management System
**Description**: Implement specialized handling for estimated value fields with validation, formatting, and configurable default values aligned with procurement requirements.

### Task 05: Smart Date Range Selection Interface
**Description**: Develop an intuitive date range selection system with predefined intervals (weekly, monthly, yearly) and automatic date calculation based on business days and Romanian calendar.

### Task 06: Automated Search Trigger and Execution System
**Description**: Implement intelligent search button detection and triggering capabilities with proper event handling for AngularJS applications and dynamic content loading.

### Task 07: Comprehensive Error Handling and User Feedback System
**Description**: Create robust error handling mechanisms with detailed logging, user notifications, and graceful fallback behaviors for various failure scenarios.

### Task 08: Message-Based Communication Architecture
**Description**: Establish type-safe message passing between popup, content script, and background components with proper async handling and response validation.

## Story Dependencies

- **Story [01]**: Project Initialization - Required for basic project structure and configuration
- **Story [02]**: Core Extension Component Structure - Required for popup interface and content script foundation
- Chrome Extension APIs for DOM manipulation and storage
- TypeScript configuration for type safety
- React components for popup interface
- Webpack build system for bundling

## Story Risks

### High Risk
- **Kendo UI Component Compatibility**: Risk that Kendo UI components may change their internal structure or behavior, breaking our interaction mechanisms
- **E-licitatie.ro Platform Updates**: Risk that the target website may update their form structure, rendering our selectors ineffective

### Medium Risk
- **AngularJS Digest Cycle Issues**: Risk of form changes not being properly detected by the AngularJS application due to improper event triggering
- **Performance Impact**: Risk of DOM manipulation causing noticeable performance degradation on complex pages with many form elements

### Low Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Risk of certain DOM manipulation features not working consistently across different Chrome versions
- **User Permission Issues**: Risk of users not granting necessary permissions for the extension to function properly

## Story Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- E-licitatie.ro continues to use the current form structure and Kendo UI component versions
- AngularJS digest cycles can be triggered programmatically through standard event mechanisms
- Chrome Extension APIs provide sufficient access to manipulate DOM elements and handle events
- TypeScript compilation and webpack bundling work consistently across development and production environments

### Business Assumptions
- Default estimated value of 20,000,000 RON remains appropriate for most procurement searches
- Date range selections align with typical procurement timeline requirements (weekly, monthly, yearly intervals)
- Target dropdown fields ("Autoritatea contractanta", "Domeniu de activitate", etc.) remain the primary focus for automation
- Users will primarily use predefined date ranges rather than custom date selections

### User Experience Assumptions
- Users prefer automated form completion over manual data entry for repetitive procurement searches
- Visual feedback and status messages are essential for user confidence in the automation process
- Radio button interface for date range selection provides sufficient flexibility without overwhelming users
- Single-click automation (autocomplete + search trigger) provides optimal user experience

### Platform Assumptions
- E-licitatie.ro maintains current accessibility standards allowing programmatic form interaction
- Website loading times allow sufficient delay for lazy-loaded content to populate before automation begins
- Search/filter buttons maintain consistent identification patterns (ID, class, ng-click attributes)
- Form validation on the target website doesn't prevent programmatic value setting

## Implementation Notes

This story represents the core functionality that transforms the Naval Auction Assistant from a basic extension into an intelligent automation tool. The implementation should prioritize reliability and user feedback, ensuring that users understand what the extension is doing at each step and can trust the automated processes.

Special attention should be paid to the interaction with Kendo UI components, as these represent the most complex technical challenge in this story. The date range selection feature should be intuitive and cover the most common use cases for procurement professionals searching for opportunities within specific timeframes.

The success of this story directly impacts user adoption, as it provides immediate value through time savings and improved search accuracy on the e-licitatie.ro platform.

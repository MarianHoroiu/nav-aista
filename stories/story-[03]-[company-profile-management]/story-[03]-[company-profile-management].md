# Story: Company Profile Management

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to implement a comprehensive company profile management system that will store and manage the capabilities, preferences, and criteria used for matching naval repair auctions. This system will provide the foundation for intelligent auction selection based on company-specific requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- TypeScript interfaces for CompanyProfile are defined with strict typing
- Chrome Storage API wrapper is implemented with error handling and retry mechanisms
- Profile creation wizard with step-by-step UI flow is working correctly
- Profile editing interface allows modification of all company parameters
- Profile import/export functionality is available
- Profile validation ensures data integrity
- Profile migration utilities support schema updates
- Visualization components display profile data effectively

## Story Tasks

1. Define comprehensive data model:

   - Create TypeScript interfaces for CompanyProfile with proper typing
   - Implement validation schemas using Zod or similar library
   - Design versioning strategy for profile schema
   - Create profile migration utilities for version updates

2. Implement storage system:

   - Develop Chrome Storage API wrapper with error handling
   - Add migration support for schema changes
   - Implement automatic sync between browser instances
   - Create caching layer for performance optimization

3. Build profile creation wizard:

   - Design multi-step profile creation flow
   - Implement validation for each step
   - Create intuitive UI for company capability input
   - Add profile templates for common configurations

4. Develop profile management UI:

   - Create profile editing interface
   - Implement profile import/export functionality
   - Build profile version management
   - Design profile backup system

5. Create profile visualization:
   - Implement visualization components for profile data
   - Create capability summary view
   - Build preference visualization
   - Design profile completeness indicator

## Story Dependencies

- Story-[01]-[project-initialization] must be completed
- Story-[02]-[core-extension-component-structure] must be completed (for UI components and storage utilities)

## Story Risks

- Complex profile data structure may be challenging to version
- Chrome Storage has size limitations that need to be managed
- User experience for profile creation needs to be intuitive despite complexity
- Profile import/export needs to handle validation and security concerns
- Storage synchronization across browsers might cause conflicts

## Story Assumptions

- Chrome Storage API will be used for storing profile data
- TypeScript interfaces will enforce data integrity
- The company profile structure follows the architecture outlined in documentation
- Profile data includes ship types, tonnage ranges, repair specializations, and geographical preferences
- Profile migration will be needed as the system evolves
- Tailwind CSS will be used for UI components

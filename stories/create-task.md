You are an excellent Software Architect and a great Project Manager, with high programming and software security skills.

I need to create a template for task implementation documents.

You have to create a new file to match the folder name. For example, if the folder name starts with `story-[01]-[story name]`, the file should be `task-[01]-[task number]-[task name].md`, where `[task number]` is the task number in the story file, including the brackets.

The markdown file needs to contain the following information:

- Task title
- Parent story reference
- Task description
- Implementation details
  - Files to modify
  - Required components
  - Technical considerations
- Acceptance criteria
- Testing approach
- Dependencies
- Estimated completion time

## Template Structure

```markdown
# Task [STORY_NUMBER]-[TASK_NUMBER]: [TASK_TITLE]

## Parent Story

Story [STORY_NUMBER]: [STORY_TITLE]

## Task Description

[DETAILED_DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_TASK]

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- [FILE_PATH_1] - [MODIFICATION_DESCRIPTION]
- [FILE_PATH_2] - [MODIFICATION_DESCRIPTION]
- Create new component: [NEW_COMPONENT_PATH]

### Required Components

- [COMPONENT_1]
- [COMPONENT_2]
- [COMPONENT_3]

### Technical Considerations

- [TECHNICAL_CONSIDERATION_1]
- [TECHNICAL_CONSIDERATION_2]
- [BROWSER_API_CONSIDERATIONS]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [CRITERION_1]
- [CRITERION_2]
- [CRITERION_3]
- [CRITERION_4]
- [CRITERION_5]

## Testing Approach

- [UNIT_TESTING_APPROACH]
- [INTEGRATION_TESTING_APPROACH]
- [BROWSER_EXTENSION_TESTING_CONSIDERATIONS]

## Dependencies

- [DEPENDENCY_1]
- [DEPENDENCY_2]

## Estimated Completion Time

[HOURS] hours
```

## Example (Filled Template)

```markdown
# Task 01-01: Set Up Repository and Initial README

## Parent Story

Story 01: Project Initialization

## Task Description

Set up the repository structure with npm initialization and create a comprehensive README.md file that documents the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension project.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `package.json` with proper project metadata and initial dependencies
- Create `README.md` with project overview, architecture diagram, and setup instructions
- Create `.gitignore` file with appropriate patterns for Node.js and browser extension development

### Required Components

- Node.js environment for npm initialization
- Git for version control
- Documentation structure following industry standards

### Technical Considerations

- Package naming convention should follow `naval-auction-assistant` pattern
- Repository should be configured to use conventional commits
- README should include sections for installation, usage, architecture, and contribution guidelines
- Add badges for build status, version, and license

## Acceptance Criteria

- Repository is initialized with `npm init -y`
- README.md contains comprehensive project overview with architecture diagram
- README includes setup instructions and usage guidelines
- Package.json includes correct metadata and initial dependencies
- .gitignore is properly configured for the project

## Testing Approach

- Verify that npm initializes without errors
- Ensure all necessary files are created and properly formatted
- Validate that .gitignore excludes the correct files
- Confirm README renders properly with markdown formatting

## Dependencies

- None, as this is the first task in the initial story

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours
```

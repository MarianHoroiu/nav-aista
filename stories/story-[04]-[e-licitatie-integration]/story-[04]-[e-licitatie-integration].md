# Story: E-licitatie.ro Integration

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to analyze and map the e-licitatie.ro platform structure to enable the extension to interact with it effectively, including detecting auction pages, understanding DOM structure, and creating activation logic for the extension.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Detailed documentation of e-licitatie.ro DOM structure is created
- Form elements and their behaviors are mapped
- Dynamic content loading patterns are identified
- Authentication flow and session management are documented
- Comprehensive mapping of semantic attribute patterns is created
- Extension activation logic is implemented based on URL patterns
- Detection logic for auction pages is functional
- Context-aware activation rules are implemented

## Story Tasks

1. Perform Site Analysis:
   - Document detailed DOM structure of e-licitatie.ro
   - Map form elements and their behaviors
   - Identify dynamic content loading patterns
   - Document authentication flow and session management
   - Create comprehensive mapping of semantic attribute patterns
   - Identify common patterns in widget-title attributes across different auctions
   - Document section naming conventions and variations
   - Map structural patterns in the DOM that remain consistent across auctions

2. Develop Extension Activation Logic:
   - Create detection logic for auction pages
   - Implement context-aware activation rules
   - Build user notification system
   - Create permission request handling
   - Develop content script activation strategies based on URL patterns
   - Implement feature flag system for selective capability activation

3. Create Site-Specific Utilities:
   - Develop DOM navigation helpers for e-licitatie.ro
   - Create selector strategies for common elements
   - Build utilities for handling site-specific challenges
   - Implement session detection and management
   - Create authentication state detection
   - Build page state detection utilities

4. Document Integration Points:
   - Map specific DOM elements that will be interaction targets
   - Document form submission and response patterns
   - Identify potential stability risks in the site's structure
   - Create guidance for handling site updates
   - Document error handling strategies for site-specific issues

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed

## Story Risks

- The e-licitatie.ro site structure may change, breaking selectors
- Dynamic content loading patterns may be inconsistent across different parts of the site
- Authentication and session handling may present security challenges
- Performance impact of DOM observation and manipulation
- Site updates during development could invalidate previous analysis

## Story Assumptions

- Access to e-licitatie.ro is available for thorough testing
- The site's structure has some consistent patterns that can be identified
- The extension will operate within the constraints of browser extension security models
- Users will have valid authentication credentials for the platform

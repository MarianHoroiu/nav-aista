# Story: Form Automation

## Story Description

As a procurement specialist, I need the extension to intelligently analyze and automatically populate search forms on e-licitatie.ro based on my company profile, so that I can quickly find relevant auction opportunities without manually filling in numerous fields.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Form fields on e-licitatie.ro are automatically detected and mapped
- Dropdown options are intelligently matched with company profile attributes
- Date range inputs are automatically populated with relevant dates
- Checkboxes are selected based on company preferences
- Form submission is automated with validation
- User can review and override automated selections
- Form state is observable and can be saved as templates
- One-click search initiation is implemented

## Story Tasks

1. Implement Form Analysis and Mapping:
   - Create specialized parser for e-licitatie.ro forms
   - Map form field structures and relationships
   - Build selector strategies for different form types
   - Implement form state serialization
   - Develop robust pattern-matching selector strategies
   - Use attribute selectors that target semantic patterns
   - Implement parent-child relationship identification for form elements
   - Create fallback mechanisms for when primary selectors fail

2. Develop Field Type Detection:
   - Create algorithms for detecting field semantics
   - Implement mapping between field types and company profile
   - Build adapters for different input types
   - Implement validation for field values
   - Design specialized handlers for date range inputs
   - Create checkbox selection logic based on company preferences

3. Implement Form State Management:
   - Create observable form state
   - Implement dirty checking for change detection
   - Build history tracking for undo functionality
   - Create form snapshots for comparison
   - Develop mechanisms to persist partially completed forms
   - Implement state synchronization between extension instances

4. Create Intelligent Selection System:
   - Implement semantic analysis of dropdown options
   - Create matching algorithms for company profile attributes
   - Build scoring system for option relevance
   - Develop confidence metrics for matches
   - Implement caching of dropdown options for performance
   - Create adaptable matchers for varying option formats
   - Build weighted matching based on company preferences
   - Implement fuzzy matching for inexact terms

5. Build User Interface for Form Automation:
   - Create interactive selection interface
   - Implement visual confidence indicators
   - Develop hover explanations for selections
   - Build manual override controls
   - Create interface for reviewing and editing automated selections
   - Implement system for saving successful selection patterns

6. Implement Search Execution:
   - Create smart submission timing
   - Implement validation pre-submission
   - Build error recovery for failed submissions
   - Develop submission confirmation UI
   - Create progress indicators for long-running searches
   - Implement retry mechanisms for interrupted submissions

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed
- Story-03-Company-Profile-Management must be completed
- Story-04-E-licitatie-Integration must be completed

## Story Risks

- Complex form structures may be difficult to reliably detect and interact with
- Intelligent selection may not always match user expectations
- Form validation errors may be difficult to interpret and resolve automatically
- Site updates could break form automation functionality
- Performance impact of complex matching algorithms
- User experience challenges in explaining automatic selections

## Story Assumptions

- The e-licitatie.ro form structure has been thoroughly analyzed
- Company profile data contains the necessary information for form field mapping
- Users will want to review and potentially override automated selections
- Form submission can be triggered programmatically without triggering anti-bot measures

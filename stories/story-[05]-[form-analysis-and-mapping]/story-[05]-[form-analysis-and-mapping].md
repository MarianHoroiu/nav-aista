# Story: Form Analysis and Mapping

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to create specialized parsers and mapping systems to understand and interact with e-licitatie.ro forms. This includes building form field structure maps, selector strategies, and form state management to enable intelligent form filling capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Specialized DOM parser for e-licitatie.ro forms is implemented
- Form field structures and relationships are accurately mapped
- Selector strategies for different form types are built and tested
- Field type detection algorithms correctly identify input purposes
- Form state serialization and management works reliably
- Form field mapping to company profile is implemented
- Form state observable pattern enables reactive updates
- State history tracking with undo functionality is available

## Story Tasks

1. Create DOM parser for forms:

   - Implement specialized parser for e-licitatie.ro forms
   - Map form field structures and their relationships
   - Build selector strategies for different form types
   - Create form structure serialization for debugging and analysis
   - Implement robust error handling for parsing failures

2. Develop field type detection:

   - Create algorithms for detecting field semantics based on attributes, labels, and context
   - Build field type classification system
   - Implement mapping between field types and company profile attributes
   - Create adapters for different input types (text, select, radio, etc.)
   - Develop validation rules for field values

3. Implement form state management:

   - Build observable form state pattern
   - Create state change detection system
   - Implement history tracking for undo functionality
   - Develop form snapshots for comparison and restoration
   - Create serialization for state persistence

4. Create mapping system:

   - Build relationship maps between company profile and form fields
   - Implement intelligent mapping algorithms
   - Create configuration system for mapping rules
   - Develop fallback strategies for ambiguous mappings
   - Build mapping visualization for debugging

5. Implement testing strategy:
   - Create unit tests for parsers and mappers
   - Build integration tests with mock form structures
   - Implement automated tests for field detection
   - Develop test cases for state management
   - Create snapshot tests for mapping configurations

## Story Dependencies

- Story-[01]-[project-initialization] must be completed
- Story-[02]-[core-extension-component-structure] must be completed
- Story-[04]-[e-licitatie-site-integration] must be completed

## Story Risks

- Form structures may be complex and vary across different parts of e-licitatie.ro
- Dynamic form behavior may be difficult to capture and model
- Field purpose detection may be challenging with unclear labels
- Form submission validation may be complex
- Site updates may break form mapping
- Romanian language fields may present challenges for semantic understanding

## Story Assumptions

- Form structures on e-licitatie.ro follow consistent patterns
- Field relationships can be determined through DOM analysis
- Company profile data can be mapped to relevant form fields
- Form state can be observed and manipulated through DOM events
- Form submissions can be intercepted and validated
- The extension will have permissions to interact with forms

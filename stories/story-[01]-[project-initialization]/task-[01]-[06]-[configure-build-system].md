# Task 01-06: Configure Build System

## Parent Story

Story 01: Project Initialization

## Task Description

Set up a comprehensive build system for the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension using Webpack. This involves configuring Webpack to handle TypeScript compilation, asset bundling, and environment-specific builds. Additionally, implement hot-reloading functionality for efficient development workflow and optimize the production build for Chrome Web Store deployment.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `webpack.common.js` for shared Webpack configuration
- Create `webpack.dev.js` for development-specific configuration
- Create `webpack.prod.js` for production-specific configuration
- Update `package.json` with build scripts
- Create `.env.development` and `.env.production` for environment variables
- Create `webpack/plugins` directory for custom Webpack plugins
- Create `webpack/loaders.js` for shared loader configurations
- Create `public/index.html` template for entry points

### Required Components

- Webpack core and CLI
- TypeScript loader for Webpack
- HTML Webpack Plugin for generating HTML assets
- Copy Webpack Plugin for static assets
- Style loaders (CSS, SCSS, PostCSS)
- Asset loaders for images and fonts
- Environment configuration system
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) setup

### Technical Considerations

- Configure separate entry points for different extension components (background, content, popup, options)
- Set up proper source maps for debugging
- Implement environment-specific configurations
- Optimize production builds (minification, tree-shaking, code splitting)
- Configure hot-reloading for development environment
- Set up asset optimization (image compression, CSS minification)
- Ensure proper handling of browser extension manifest
- Configure incremental builds for better development experience
- Implement proper error reporting during build process
- Set up clean build directory functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- Webpack is properly configured for development and production environments
- TypeScript files are correctly compiled
- Development builds include source maps for debugging
- Production builds are optimized and minified
- Static assets are properly handled and copied to the build directory
- Hot Module Replacement works for applicable components
- Environment variables are properly handled in different build modes
- Build scripts are added to package.json (`build`, `build:dev`, `build:prod`, `watch`)
- Clean build process that removes previous build artifacts
- Extension can be loaded from the build directory in development mode
- Build system handles all required file types (TS, TSX, CSS, SCSS, images, etc.)
- Proper error reporting during build process

## Testing Approach

- Test development build with hot reloading
- Verify production build output for optimization
- Load built extension in Chrome/Edge to verify functionality
- Test incremental builds with file changes
- Verify environment variable handling
- Test error reporting with intentional build errors
- Validate build performance and optimization

## Dependencies

- Task 01-02: Configure TypeScript with Appropriate Settings
- Task 01-05: Set Up Browser Extension Infrastructure

## Estimated Completion Time

# Task 01-07: Integrate React

## Parent Story

Story 01: Project Initialization

## Task Description

Integrate React with TypeScript into the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension and set up a modern styling architecture using Tailwind CSS. This task includes configuring the necessary React dependencies, setting up proper TypeScript type definitions, creating foundational React components, and establishing a CSS/SCSS processing pipeline with Tailwind for a consistent and maintainable UI.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Update `package.json` to include React and related dependencies
- Create `tsconfig.react.json` with React-specific TypeScript settings
- Create `tailwind.config.js` for Tailwind CSS configuration
- Create `postcss.config.js` for PostCSS integration
- Create `src/styles/global.scss` for global styles
- Create `src/components/common` directory with base UI components
- Create `src/popup/Popup.tsx` as a sample React component
- Create `src/options/Options.tsx` as a sample React component
- Update Webpack configuration to handle React and CSS/SCSS processing

### Required Components

- React and React DOM
- TypeScript types for React
- Tailwind CSS framework
- PostCSS for processing CSS
- SCSS compiler
- React component structure
- Theme configuration
- React testing library

### Technical Considerations

- Configure JSX compilation with TypeScript
- Set up proper React component typing with TypeScript
- Implement responsive design principles for extension UI
- Establish a component architecture following best practices
- Configure efficient CSS processing pipeline
- Set up CSS purging for production builds
- Implement theming support (light/dark mode)
- Ensure browser extension context awareness in React components
- Configure React Developer Tools integration for development
- Set up React state management approach (Context API or Redux)
- Ensure proper typing for React props and state

## Acceptance Criteria

- React and ReactDOM are properly installed and configured
- TypeScript integration with React works correctly
- Tailwind CSS is configured and working with CSS/SCSS
- PostCSS is set up for processing Tailwind directives
- Base UI components are created with proper TypeScript typing
- Sample popup and options page React components are functional
- Styling system is established with Tailwind utility classes
- Component architecture follows React best practices
- Build system correctly processes React components
- Hot reloading works for React components in development
- Dark/light theme support is implemented
- React components can access browser extension APIs
- Code splitting is properly configured for React components

## Testing Approach

- Create test React components to verify TypeScript integration
- Test Tailwind CSS utility classes on components
- Verify responsive design with different viewport sizes
- Test React component rendering in browser extension context
- Validate theme switching functionality
- Test component hot reloading in development
- Verify correct type checking for React props and state
- Test browser extension API access from React components

## Dependencies

- Task 01-02: Configure TypeScript with Appropriate Settings
- Task 01-05: Set Up Browser Extension Infrastructure
- Task 01-06: Configure Build System

## Estimated Completion Time

# Task 01-08: Create Basic Project Structure

## Parent Story

Story 01: Project Initialization

## Task Description

Implement the foundational project structure for the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension following the architecture outlined in the documentation. This involves establishing the core directories, setting up the module boundaries, creating placeholder components, and implementing the basic architecture patterns that will govern the extension's development.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create core architectural directories following the defined architecture
- Create `src/core` directory for shared domain models and services
- Create `src/features` directory for feature-specific modules
- Create `src/infrastructure` directory for technical services and API clients
- Create `src/types` directory for shared TypeScript types and interfaces
- Implement module boundary enforcement
- Create README updates with architecture documentation
- Create placeholder components for each architectural layer

### Required Components

- Core domain models and entities
- Feature module structure
- Infrastructure services interfaces
- Module boundaries and access patterns
- Type definitions for domain objects
- Architecture documentation

### Technical Considerations

- Implement clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- Define explicit module boundaries to prevent inappropriate dependencies
- Create consistent naming conventions across the project
- Establish patterns for cross-cutting concerns (logging, error handling)
- Design scalable feature module structure
- Implement domain-driven design concepts where appropriate
- Define proper dependency flow between architectural layers
- Create infrastructure abstractions for external dependencies
- Document architectural decisions and patterns
- Plan for future extensibility of the architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

- Project structure follows the defined architecture
- Core domain models and entities are properly structured
- Feature modules have clear boundaries and organization
- Infrastructure services are properly abstracted
- Module boundaries prevent inappropriate dependencies
- Appropriate interfaces are defined between layers
- Architecture allows for future extensibility
- Documentation clearly explains the architectural approach
- Naming conventions are consistent throughout the project
- Project structure facilitates separation of concerns
- Type definitions are properly organized and shared
- Architecture supports the required extension components (background, content, popup)

## Testing Approach

- Review directory structure against architectural documentation
- Verify module boundaries by attempting inappropriate imports
- Test component organization by creating sample components
- Validate consistency of naming conventions
- Review documentation for clarity and completeness
- Evaluate architecture against common extension development patterns
- Verify project structure supports all required extension components

## Dependencies

- Task 01-02: Configure TypeScript with Appropriate Settings
- Task 01-05: Set Up Browser Extension Infrastructure
- Task 01-06: Configure Build System
- Task 01-07: Integrate React

## Estimated Completion Time

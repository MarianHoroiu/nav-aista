# Task 01-03: Implement Code Quality Infrastructure

## Parent Story

Story 01: Project Initialization

## Task Description

Set up a comprehensive code quality infrastructure for the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension project. This includes configuring ESLint for static code analysis, integrating Prettier for consistent code formatting, and establishing pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality standards before code is committed to the repository.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `.eslintrc.js` with TypeScript and browser extension specific rules
- Create `.prettierrc` with project formatting standards
- Create `.prettierignore` for files that should not be formatted
- Update `package.json` to include code quality dependencies and scripts
- Set up `.husky` directory with pre-commit hooks
- Create `lint-staged.config.js` for running checks on staged files

### Required Components

- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for Git hooks
- lint-staged for running linters on staged files

### Technical Considerations

- Configure ESLint specifically for browser extension development
  - Include React-specific rules
  - Add browser extension patterns and globals
  - Enable TypeScript-specific linting rules
- Set up Prettier with industry-standard settings
- Configure ESLint and Prettier to work together harmoniously
- Implement Git hooks that run before commits to enforce standards
- Create npm scripts for manual linting and formatting
- Set up VS Code integration for real-time linting and formatting

## Acceptance Criteria

- ESLint is installed and configured with the following packages:
  - eslint
  - @typescript-eslint/parser
  - @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
  - eslint-plugin-react (for React components)
  - eslint-plugin-import (for import order)
- Prettier is installed and configured:
  - prettier
  - eslint-config-prettier
  - eslint-plugin-prettier
- Pre-commit hooks are set up with:
  - husky
  - lint-staged
- Configuration files are created:
  - .eslintrc.js with appropriate rules
  - .prettierrc with formatting standards
  - lint-staged.config.js
- npm scripts are added to package.json:
  - "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx"
  - "format": "prettier --write ."
- Pre-commit hooks run linting and formatting on staged files
- ESLint successfully lints TypeScript files
- Prettier successfully formats code according to standards

## Testing Approach

- Run ESLint manually to verify configuration
- Create test files with deliberate linting errors to verify rules
- Test Prettier formatting on different file types
- Test the pre-commit hook by attempting to commit code with linting errors
- Verify VS Code integration (if applicable)
- Ensure compatibility with TypeScript configuration

## Dependencies

- Task 01-01: Set Up Repository and Initial README (for package.json)
- Task 01-02: Configure TypeScript with Appropriate Settings

## Estimated Completion Time

# Task 01-01: Set Up Repository and Initial README

## Parent Story

Story 01: Project Initialization

## Task Description

Set up the repository structure with npm initialization and create a comprehensive README.md file that documents the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension project. This involves initializing the package.json with the correct project metadata, creating a detailed README with architecture diagrams, and establishing the foundation for version control with appropriate configurations.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `package.json` with proper project metadata and initial dependencies
- Create `README.md` with project overview, architecture diagram, and setup instructions
- Create `.gitignore` file with appropriate patterns for Node.js and browser extension development
- Configure `.npmrc` for consistent package management

### Required Components

- Node.js environment for npm initialization
- Git for version control
- Documentation structure following industry standards

### Technical Considerations

- Package naming convention should follow `naval-auction-assistant` pattern
- Repository should be configured to use conventional commits standard
- README should include sections for:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Architecture diagram (can be copied from documentation)
  - Setup instructions
  - Development workflow
  - Browser extension usage guide
  - Contribution guidelines
- Initial package.json should include metadata for browser extension development

## Acceptance Criteria

- Repository is initialized with `npm init -y`
- README.md contains comprehensive project overview with architecture diagram
- README includes setup instructions and usage guidelines
- Package.json includes correct metadata and initial dependencies
- .gitignore is properly configured for the project
- .npmrc is configured for consistent package management
- Conventional commits standard is established

## Testing Approach

- Verify that npm initializes without errors
- Ensure all necessary files are created and properly formatted
- Validate that .gitignore excludes the correct files and directories:
  - node_modules
  - dist
  - build
  - .cache
  - coverage
- Confirm README renders properly with markdown formatting
- Verify package.json contains all required fields

## Dependencies

- None, as this is the first task in the initial story

## Estimated Completion Time

2 hours

# Story: Project Initialization

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to set up the foundational project structure and necessary configurations to start building the Naval Auction Assistant browser extension. This includes establishing the repository, configuring TypeScript, implementing code quality tools, and setting up the browser extension infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Repository is initialized with proper package.json and README
- TypeScript is configured with strict type checking
- ESLint and Prettier are set up for code quality
- Testing framework (Jest) is configured
- Browser extension manifest is created with the necessary permissions
- Build system is configured with Webpack
- React is integrated with TypeScript
- The project structure follows the architecture outlined in the documentation

## Story Tasks

1. Set up the repository with npm init and create the initial README.md
2. Configure TypeScript with appropriate settings:
   - Install TypeScript and type definitions
   - Create tsconfig.json with strict mode and proper module resolution
   - Set up separate configs for different build targets
3. Implement code quality infrastructure:
   - Set up ESLint with TypeScript support
   - Configure Prettier for consistent code style
   - Add pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
4. Configure testing framework:
   - Install and set up Jest with TypeScript support
   - Create testing utilities for browser extension environment
5. Set up browser extension infrastructure:
   - Create manifest.json with appropriate permissions
   - Set up basic folder structure for extension components
6. Configure build system:
   - Install and configure Webpack for browser extension
   - Set up environment-specific builds
   - Implement hot-reloading for development
7. Integrate React:
   - Install React and type definitions
   - Configure with TypeScript
   - Set up CSS/SCSS processing with Tailwind
8. Create basic project structure following the architecture diagram

## Story Dependencies

- None, as this is the initial story for project setup

## Story Risks

- Compatibility issues between different library versions
- Complexity in configuring Webpack for browser extension development
- Potential challenges with TypeScript configuration for browser extensions
- Ensuring the setup supports all planned features from the architecture

## Story Assumptions

- The development will be done using Node.js environment
- Chrome/Edge compatibility is a priority (Manifest V3)
- React will be the frontend framework for the extension UI
- Tailwind CSS will be used for styling
- The project will follow the architecture outlined in the documentation
- Development will be done in TypeScript with strict type checking

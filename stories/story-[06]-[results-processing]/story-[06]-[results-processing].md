# Story: Results Processing

## Story Description

As a procurement specialist, I need the extension to extract, structure, and present auction search results in a clear, sortable interface within the extension, so I can quickly identify potentially relevant opportunities without having to navigate the complex e-licitatie.ro results pages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- First 10 search results are automatically extracted after form submission
- A structured, sortable results interface is created within the extension
- Key auction metadata is extracted including title, reference number, contracting authority, deadlines, value, and status
- Result state is preserved between sessions
- Results view can be customized with sorting and filtering options
- User can save interesting results for later review
- Result details can be expanded for more information

## Story Tasks

1. Implement Result Extraction:
   - Create parser for search results page on e-licitatie.ro
   - Build extraction logic for first 10 search results
   - Implement pagination handling if needed
   - Create result normalization and structuring system
   - Develop retry mechanism for failed extractions
   - Build error recovery for unexpected result formats

2. Create Results Data Model:
   - Define TypeScript interfaces for structured auction results
   - Implement storage and caching for results
   - Create serialization and deserialization utilities
   - Design history tracking for previous searches
   - Build data structures for saved/favorites functionality
   - Implement result state persistence between sessions

3. Develop Results Dashboard UI:
   - Create sortable, filterable results list component
   - Implement column configuration for customizable views
   - Build result card components with expandable details
   - Create action buttons for result interactions
   - Implement sorting and filtering capabilities in the UI
   - Develop saved results/favorites view

4. Implement Result Actions:
   - Create navigation to original auction page
   - Build save/favorite functionality
   - Implement document download action
   - Create result sharing capability
   - Build auction detail view within extension
   - Implement dismiss/hide functionality for irrelevant results

5. Create Result Analytics:
   - Implement basic relevance scoring based on company profile
   - Build visualization for result metadata
   - Create summary statistics for search results
   - Develop tracking for frequently appearing authorities
   - Implement deadline highlighting for urgent opportunities
   - Build comparison view for multiple results

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed
- Story-03-Company-Profile-Management must be completed
- Story-04-E-licitatie-Integration must be completed
- Story-05-Form-Automation must be completed

## Story Risks

- Inconsistent result formats on e-licitatie.ro may cause extraction errors
- Performance issues with large result sets
- Storage limitations for result history in browser extension
- User interface challenges in presenting complex result data clearly
- Handling updates to results that may change over time

## Story Assumptions

- The search functionality on e-licitatie.ro is working properly
- Results page has a consistent structure that can be reliably parsed
- The first 10 results are sufficient for initial assessment
- Key metadata is available in the search results without deep navigation
- Users will want to preserve result state between sessions

# Story: Intelligent Selection System

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to implement an intelligent selection system that can analyze form options, especially dropdowns, and automatically select the most relevant values based on the company profile. This system will be critical for automating the auction search process with high accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Semantic analysis of dropdown options is implemented
- Matching algorithms between options and company profile attributes are working
- Scoring system for option relevance is created and validated
- Interactive selection interface with visual confidence indicators is built
- Manual override controls are implemented and working
- Fuzzy matching for inexact terms functions properly
- Explanation system for selection decisions is available
- Confidence metrics are provided for all automatic selections

## Story Tasks

1. Implement dropdown analysis:

   - Create semantic analysis system for dropdown options
   - Build extraction and normalization of option values
   - Implement option categorization by semantic purpose
   - Develop option relationship mapping
   - Create multilingual support for option analysis

2. Build matching algorithms:

   - Create weighted matching based on company preferences
   - Implement fuzzy matching for inexact terms
   - Build similarity scoring for text options
   - Develop category-specific matching rules
   - Create confidence calculation for each match

3. Create selection system:

   - Implement auto-selection based on match scores
   - Build fallback strategies for low-confidence matches
   - Create selection history tracking
   - Develop adaptive selection improvement
   - Implement batch selection for related fields

4. Develop explanation system:

   - Build explanation generator for selection decisions
   - Create visual indicators for selection confidence
   - Implement hover explanations for selected options
   - Develop detailed explanation panel
   - Create logs for selection reasoning

5. Build interactive interface:
   - Create interactive selection UI with confidence indicators
   - Implement manual override controls
   - Build alternative suggestion panel
   - Develop preview system for selection outcomes
   - Create undo/redo functionality for selections

## Story Dependencies

- Story-[01]-[project-initialization] must be completed
- Story-[02]-[core-extension-component-structure] must be completed
- Story-[03]-[company-profile-management] must be completed
- Story-[04]-[e-licitatie-site-integration] must be completed
- Story-[05]-[form-analysis-and-mapping] must be completed

## Story Risks

- Semantic analysis of dropdown options may be challenging, especially in Romanian
- Confidence scoring may require tuning for accuracy
- User interface for selection must be intuitive despite complexity
- Dropdown options may be ambiguous or have unclear meaning
- Performance issues with large dropdown lists
- Multiple related fields may have interdependencies

## Story Assumptions

- Dropdown options contain meaningful text that can be analyzed
- Company profile contains preferences that can be mapped to dropdown options
- Users will accept automatic selections with sufficient confidence
- Manual overrides will be needed for some selections
- Fuzzy matching will be sufficient for most option matching
- Extension will have permissions to modify form selections

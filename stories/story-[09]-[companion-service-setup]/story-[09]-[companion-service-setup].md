# Story: Companion Service Setup

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to establish the companion service architecture to handle advanced document processing and AI-powered analysis that cannot be performed within the browser extension environment, enabling more sophisticated document understanding and relevance assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Node.js/Express application is set up with TypeScript
- RESTful API structure is implemented with versioning
- Authentication system with JWT is configured
- Document processing pipeline architecture is designed
- MongoDB integration is established with appropriate schemas
- Secure communication between extension and service is implemented
- Service deployment configuration is created

## Story Tasks

1. Setup Node.js/Express Application:
   - Initialize Express.js application with TypeScript
   - Implement RESTful API structure with versioning
   - Create authentication system with JWT
   - Build rate limiting and security measures
   - Implement logging and monitoring infrastructure
   - Create deployment configurations for various environments

2. Design Document Processing Pipeline:
   - Create extensible pipeline architecture
   - Implement worker-based processing for scalability
   - Build document queue management
   - Develop processing status tracking
   - Create priority-based processing system
   - Implement notification system for completed analyses

3. Integrate MongoDB:
   - Set up MongoDB with Mongoose
   - Design schemas for company profiles and documents
   - Implement efficient indexing strategy
   - Create data migration utilities
   - Develop backup and recovery procedures
   - Implement data retention policies

4. Establish Extension-Service Communication:
   - Create secure communication protocol
   - Implement authenticated API endpoints
   - Build request validation and sanitization
   - Develop comprehensive error handling
   - Create rate limiting and abuse prevention
   - Implement monitoring and alerting

5. Create Service Deployment Infrastructure:
   - Set up Docker containerization
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Create scaling configuration
   - Develop monitoring and logging infrastructure
   - Build backup and disaster recovery procedures
   - Implement security hardening

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Story-02-Core-Extension-Component-Structure must be completed

## Story Risks

- Security challenges in authentication between extension and service
- Scalability issues with document processing pipeline
- Deployment complexity in production environment
- Data synchronization between extension and service
- Performance bottlenecks in document processing
- Database sizing and scaling for document storage

## Story Assumptions

- Node.js is appropriate for the processing requirements
- MongoDB is suitable for the document and profile storage needs
- The extension and service can communicate securely over HTTPS
- Processing resources are sufficient for the expected document volume
- Deployment environment supports necessary infrastructure
- Authentication can be handled securely between components

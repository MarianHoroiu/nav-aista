# Task [02]-[02]: Develop Content Script Architecture

## Parent Story

Story [02]: Core Extension Component Structure

## Task Description

Create a modular content script architecture with DOM utilities specifically designed for e-licitatie.ro, including site-specific detection, activation logic, mutation observers for dynamic content, and flexible CSS attribute selectors that can adapt to varying attribute values.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `src/content/index.ts` - Main content script entry point
- Create `src/content/dom/index.ts` - DOM utility functions
- Create `src/content/dom/selectors.ts` - CSS selector strategies
- Create `src/content/dom/traverse.ts` - DOM traversal utilities
- Create `src/content/detection/index.ts` - Site detection and activation
- Create `src/content/observers/index.ts` - Mutation observers
- Update `manifest.json` - Register content scripts with appropriate matches

### Required Components

- Site-specific DOM utility functions
- Pattern-based CSS attribute selector system
- Flexible DOM traversal utilities
- Page detection and content script activation logic
- Mutation observers for dynamic content monitoring
- Fallback strategies for DOM element selection
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Technical Considerations

- The content script must work with e-licitatie.ro's specific DOM structure
- Selectors should target semantic patterns rather than exact DOM paths
- Must handle dynamic content loading through mutation observers
- Should implement parent-child relationship identification for form elements
- Need multiple selection paths to locate critical elements when primary selectors fail
- Must normalize attribute values (case-insensitive, whitespace handling)
- Performance considerations for DOM traversal and mutation observers
- Content script injection timing and strategy needs careful consideration

## Acceptance Criteria

- Content script successfully injects and activates on e-licitatie.ro pages
- DOM utilities can reliably locate and interact with key page elements
- Attribute selectors can find elements even when exact attributes change
- Mutation observers correctly detect and respond to dynamic content changes
- DOM traversal utilities can navigate complex page structures
- Fallback mechanisms work when primary selectors fail
- Content script remains performant without causing page slowdowns
- All utilities are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Running the `npm run check` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation
- Running the `npm run build` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for DOM utility functions using JSDOM
- Integration tests with sample HTML structures from e-licitatie.ro
- Mock mutation events to test observer functionality
- Test selector strategies with variations of attribute values
- Performance testing for DOM traversal on complex structures
- E2E testing on actual e-licitatie.ro pages
- Manual testing across different pages on the platform

## Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Understanding of e-licitatie.ro DOM structure
- Chrome extension content script APIs
- MutationObserver browser API

## Estimated Completion Time

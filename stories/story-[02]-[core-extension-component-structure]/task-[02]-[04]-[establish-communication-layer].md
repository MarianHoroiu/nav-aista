# Task [02]-[04]: Establish Communication Layer

## Parent Story

Story [02]: Core Extension Component Structure

## Task Description

Create a robust messaging system to enable communication between different components of the extension (background service worker, content scripts, popup UI), including typed message interfaces, error handling, event listeners for state changes, and a consistent API for all inter-component communication.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `src/shared/messaging/index.ts` - Common messaging utilities
- Create `src/shared/messaging/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for messages
- Create `src/shared/messaging/errors.ts` - Error handling for messaging
- Create `src/shared/messaging/events.ts` - Event definitions
- Update `src/background/messaging/index.ts` - Background message handling
- Update `src/content/messaging/index.ts` - Content script message handling
- Update `src/ui/services/messaging.ts` - UI message handling

### Required Components

- Typed message definitions for all communication channels
- Message dispatcher and handler system
- Error handling and recovery for message failures
- Event listeners for state changes
- Promise-based API for request-response patterns
- Broadcast capabilities for one-to-many communication
- Retry mechanisms for failed communications

### Technical Considerations

- Must handle the unique constraints of Chrome extension messaging
- Need to implement proper type safety for all messages
- Should handle disconnection and reconnection scenarios
- Must consider message size limitations in Chrome extensions
- Need separate handling for different contexts (background, content, popup)
- Should implement timeout handling for message responses
- Error handling should be comprehensive and recoverable
- Security considerations for message content

## Acceptance Criteria

- All extension components can reliably communicate with each other
- Message types are properly defined with TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling gracefully manages messaging failures
- Event listeners correctly respond to state changes
- Promise-based API works for request-response patterns
- Messages are delivered consistently even across context boundaries
- Timeout handling prevents hanging operations
- Retry mechanisms recover from temporary failures
- All messaging is properly typed and validated
- Running the `npm run check` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation
- Running the `npm run build` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for messaging utilities
- Integration tests for cross-component communication
- Mock Chrome messaging APIs for testing
- Timeout and error scenario testing
- Performance testing for large message payloads
- Testing retry mechanisms with simulated failures
- End-to-end testing of communication flows
- Manual testing in actual extension environment

## Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Background service worker implementation
- Content script architecture
- React UI components
- Chrome extension messaging APIs

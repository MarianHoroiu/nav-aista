# Story: Core Extension Component Structure

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to establish the foundational components of the browser extension, including the background service worker, content scripts architecture, and basic UI framework. This will create the structural backbone for all future functionality of the Naval Auction Assistant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Background service worker is implemented with proper lifecycle management (install, update, uninstall)
- Message handling system is established between all extension components
- Content script architecture is developed with modular structure
- DOM utilities specific to e-licitatie.ro are created
- React UI components are set up following atomic design principles
- Tailwind CSS is properly integrated for styling
- Storage management utilities are functioning
- Extension components are properly tested

## Story Tasks

1. Implement background service worker:

   - Create service worker with event-based architecture
   - Implement lifecycle event handlers (install, update, uninstall)
   - Set up message passing system for communication between components
   - Implement basic error handling and logging

2. Develop content script architecture:

   - Create modular content script structure
   - Implement DOM utilities specific to e-licitatie.ro
   - Develop site-specific detection and activation logic
   - Create mutation observer for dynamic content

3. Build React UI components:

   - Set up Tailwind CSS integration
   - Create component library following atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
   - Implement responsive popup interface
   - Develop settings management UI

4. Implement storage management:

   - Create unified storage API wrapper
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Set up storage initialization on installation

5. Create testing framework for components:
   - Set up unit tests for background service worker
   - Create tests for content script modules
   - Implement UI component testing

## Story Dependencies

- Story-[01]-[project-initialization] must be completed

## Story Risks

- Manifest V3 restrictions may limit service worker capabilities
- Communication between different extension components may be complex
- React integration with extension contexts requires careful architecture
- Chrome/Edge compatibility might present challenges
- Content script interaction with e-licitatie.ro DOM may break with site updates

## Story Assumptions

- The project follows the architecture outlined in documentation
- React will be used for all UI components
- Tailwind CSS will be used for styling
- Browser extension will be compatible with Chrome and Edge
- The extension will primarily interact with e-licitatie.ro website
- TypeScript will be used for all component development

# Story: Core Extension Component Structure

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to establish the foundational structure of the browser extension components to enable communication and functionality across different parts of the extension. This includes setting up the background service worker, content scripts, and React UI components to operate within the e-licitatie.ro environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Background service worker is implemented with event-based architecture
- Content script architecture is developed with DOM utilities specific to e-licitatie.ro
- React UI components are created following atomic design principles
- Components can communicate with each other via a well-defined messaging system
- DOM traversal utilities can adapt to varying attribute values
- UI is responsive and properly integrates with Tailwind CSS
- Component structure aligns with the architectural design in the documentation

## Story Tasks

1. Implement Background Service Worker:
   - Create service worker with event-based architecture
   - Implement lifecycle management (install, update, uninstall)
   - Set up message handling system between components
   - Create storage management utilities
   - Implement document download handling for PDF and archive files

2. Develop Content Script Architecture:
   - Develop modular content script structure
   - Implement DOM utilities for e-licitatie.ro
   - Create site-specific detection and activation logic
   - Build mutation observer for dynamic content
   - Implement pattern-based CSS attribute selectors for dynamic section identification
   - Create flexible DOM traversal utilities that can adapt to varying attribute values

3. Create React UI Components:
   - Set up Tailwind CSS integration
   - Create component library following atomic design
   - Implement responsive popup interface
   - Develop settings management UI
   - Build dedicated results dashboard component
   - Create document viewer component with highlighting capabilities
   - Implement analysis report interface

4. Establish Communication Layer:
   - Create a messaging system for component communication
   - Implement error handling for messaging
   - Set up event listeners for state changes
   - Create typed interfaces for message payloads

## Story Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed

## Story Risks

- Complexity in creating DOM utilities that can adapt to e-licitatie.ro's dynamic structure
- Challenges in establishing reliable communication between extension components
- Potential issues with React integration in a browser extension context
- Performance concerns with mutation observers and DOM traversal utilities

## Story Assumptions

- The project has been initialized with TypeScript, ESLint, and React as per Story-01
- The e-licitatie.ro site structure has been adequately analyzed
- Tailwind CSS is configured correctly for styling
- Manifest V3 is being used for browser extension development

# Task [02]-[03]: Create React UI Components

## Parent Story

Story [02]: Core Extension Component Structure

## Task Description

Develop React UI components following atomic design principles, including Tailwind CSS integration, responsive popup interface, settings management UI, results dashboard, document viewer with highlighting capabilities, and analysis report interface.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `src/ui/index.tsx` - Main UI entry point
- Create `src/ui/atoms/` - Directory for atomic components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Create `src/ui/molecules/` - Directory for molecule components (form groups, cards, etc.)
- Create `src/ui/organisms/` - Directory for organism components (results table, document viewer, etc.)
- Create `src/ui/templates/` - Layout templates for different screens
- Create `src/ui/pages/` - Full page components (popup, settings, etc.)
- Create `src/ui/styles/tailwind.css` - Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styles
- Update `src/popup.html` - Connect to React components
- Update `webpack.config.js` - Configure for React and Tailwind

### Required Components

- Responsive popup interface
- Settings management UI
- Results dashboard for displaying auction opportunities
- Document viewer with highlighting capabilities
- Analysis report interface
- Navigation system between different views
- Error and loading states for all components
- Form components for user input

### Technical Considerations

- Components should follow atomic design principles for scalability
- Tailwind CSS should be properly configured with purging for production
- UI should be responsive and work in the extension popup context
- Components should be stateless where possible for maintainability
- Need to implement proper state management (React Context, Redux, etc.)
- Must handle communication with background service worker
- Performance considerations for rendering large result sets or documents
- Accessibility should be considered for all interactive elements

## Acceptance Criteria

- All components render correctly in the extension popup
- Tailwind CSS is integrated and working properly
- UI is responsive and adapts to different popup sizes
- Settings management interface allows user configuration
- Results dashboard displays auction data in a clear, sortable format
- Document viewer can display PDFs with highlighting
- Analysis report interface clearly presents document insights
- Components follow atomic design principles
- All components are properly typed with TypeScript
- UI is visually consistent with the design guidelines
- Running the `npm run check` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation
- Running the `npm run build` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for individual components using React Testing Library
- Snapshot testing for UI components
- Mock service worker interactions for testing
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Test accessibility using axe-core
- User interaction tests for form elements and navigation
- Cross-browser testing for Chrome and Edge
- Manual testing for responsive behavior

## Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- React and ReactDOM setup
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- TypeScript setup for React
- State management solution

## Estimated Completion Time

20 hours

# Task [02]-[01]: Implement Background Service Worker

## Parent Story

Story [02]: Core Extension Component Structure

## Task Description

Implement a background service worker for the browser extension that will handle event-based architecture, lifecycle management, message handling between components, storage management, and document download capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify

- Create `src/background/index.ts` - Main service worker entry point
- Create `src/background/events/index.ts` - Event handling system
- Create `src/background/lifecycle/index.ts` - Install, update, uninstall handlers
- Create `src/background/messaging/index.ts` - Message handling system
- Create `src/background/storage/index.ts` - Storage management utilities
- Create `src/background/downloads/index.ts` - Document download handlers
- Update `manifest.json` - Register background service worker

### Required Components

- Service Worker registration in manifest.json
- Event emitter system for handling extension events
- Storage wrapper for Chrome Storage API
- Message passing system between extension components
- Download manager for PDF and archive files
- Error handling and logging utilities

### Technical Considerations

- Must use Manifest V3 service worker approach instead of background pages
- Need to handle service worker lifecycle events properly (install, update, uninstall)
- Should implement persistent storage strategy within Chrome Storage API limitations
- Must handle message passing between different contexts (popup, content scripts)
- Need to implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Should consider browser compatibility across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
- Downloads need to handle various document formats including PDFs and archives

## Acceptance Criteria

- Service worker successfully registers and activates on extension installation
- Lifecycle events (install, update, uninstall) are properly handled
- Service worker can receive and respond to messages from popup and content scripts
- Storage utilities can save, retrieve, and manage extension data
- Document download functionality can handle PDF and archive files
- Service worker remains responsive and doesn't crash under load
- All functionality is properly typed with TypeScript
- Error handling gracefully manages unexpected situations
- Running the `npm run check` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation
- Running the `npm run build` command should not return any errors/warnings: if there are any, you need to fix them following the instructions from the error message and by reading the appropriate library/dependency documentation

## Testing Approach

- Unit tests for each module using Jest
- Mock Chrome extension APIs for testing
- Integration tests for message passing between components
- Simulate lifecycle events to test proper handling
- Test storage operations with mock data
- Test download functionality with sample documents
- Manual testing in Chrome and Edge browsers

## Dependencies

- Story-01-Project-Initialization must be completed
- Chrome extension APIs for background services
- TypeScript configuration for service workers
- Storage and messaging APIs

## Estimated Completion Time

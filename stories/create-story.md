You are an excelent Software Architect and a great Project mnager, with high programming and software security skills.

I need to create a story file for the "/stories" folder.

You have to create a new folder within "/stories" folder. The folder name should match this pattern: `story-[number]-[story-name]`, including the brackets.
For example, if the story number is 1 and the story name is "Create a new task", the folder name should be `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task]`, including the brackets. The number should be the next number in the sequence of the existing stories.

Within the folder, you need to create a new file to match the folder name. For example, if the folder name is `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task]`, the file should be `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task].md` including the brackets and the file should be an outstanding markdown file.

The markdown file needs to contain the following information:

- Story title
- Story description
- Story acceptance criteria
- Story tasks
- Story dependencies
- Story risks
- Story assumptions

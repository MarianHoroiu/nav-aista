You are an excelent Software Architect and a great Project Manager, with high programming and software security skills.

I need to create a story file in current working folder. You have to make online research to find the best practices for the story file.

You have to create a new folder within the current working folder. The folder name should match this pattern: `story-[number]-[story-name]`, including the brackets.
For example, if the story number is 1 and the story name is "Create a new task", the folder name should be `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task]`, including the brackets. The number should be the next number in the sequence of the existing stories.

Within the folder, you need to create a new file to match the folder name. For example, if the folder name is `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task]`, the file should be `story-[01]-[create-a-new-task].md` including the brackets. The file should be an outstanding markdown file, with a great structure and content, following the best practices of the industry and markdown format.

The markdown file needs to contain the following information:

- Story title
- Story description
- Story acceptance criteria
- Story tasks with the following information:
  - Task title
  - Task description
- Story dependencies
- Story risks
- Story assumptions

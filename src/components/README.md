# UI Components Layer

This directory contains shared UI components organized using Atomic Design principles.

## Purpose

The components layer provides reusable UI building blocks that are used across different features of the application. By following Atomic Design methodology, we ensure a consistent design system and promote component reuse.

## Organization

- `atoms/`: Fundamental building blocks
  - Buttons, inputs, labels, icons
  - The smallest, indivisible components
- `molecules/`: Simple combinations of atoms
  - Form controls, search bars, card elements
  - Groups of atoms that function together
- `organisms/`: Complex UI sections
  - Header, navigation, profile cards
  - Relatively complex components composed of molecules and atoms
- `templates/`: Page-level layouts
  - Layout templates for different views
  - Component arrangements without specific content

## Design Principles

1. **Composition**: Build complex components by composing simpler ones
2. **Reusability**: Components should be designed for reuse across the application
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single, well-defined purpose
4. **Consistent API**: Maintain consistent props and event handling patterns
5. **Styling Isolation**: Use CSS modules or Tailwind to isolate styling

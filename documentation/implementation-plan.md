  - Avoid nth-child selectors when possible as they're vulnerable to DOM structure changes
  - Create selectors based on semantic meaning rather than visual presentation
  - Always normalize case by converting strings to lowercase when comparing attribute values or content

- **Implement Selector Redundancy**
  - Create multiple selection paths to the same target element
  - Implement fallback selector chains that try increasingly general patterns
  - Use a scoring system to evaluate the confidence of different selector paths

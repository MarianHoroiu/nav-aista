I'd like to start working on the task

## Request

PLease help me to implement this task by:

1. Reviewing the task requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Reviewing relevant existing code in the codebase
3. Proposing an implementation approach that:
   - Alligns with our project architecture
   - Follows established patterns
   - maintains clear boundaries with related tasks
   - Consider potentian integration points
   - Follow guidelines in /product-info

Before suggesting code changes, please outline your understanding of the task and proposed approach so we can confirm we're on the right track.

## Specific Guidance

- Focus only on the scope task but take into account what is in other tasks so you won't overlap
- Linting and type-checks should have no issues. Check with `npm run check` after you finished.
- Don't do tests.

Let's begin by reviewing the task details and relevant code to establish our implementation plan.

IMPORTANT!!!!!!!

- Identify related files that needs to be checked and read the actual implementation code ALWAIS!!!
- ALWAIS CHECK existing package.json file
- ALWAIS CHECK guidelines in /documentations
- ALWAIS CHECK tsconfig.json for path aliases and tech stack
